# Bayesian Halo

## Description
This repository holds the source code for my analysis of two [Halo Infinite](https://www.xbox.com/games/halo-infinite) matches. You can access the final report here: https://giuseppett.github.io/bayesian-halo/report.html

## Analysis abstract
**Introduction:** I used bayesian stats to model a match of [Halo Infinite](https://www.xbox.com/games/halo-infinite). The game consists of 2 teams of 12 players that must score points by defeating players of the other team. A team wins if it is the first to achieve 100 points or has the biggest score by the 15 minutes mark.

**Results:** The model obtained a median absolute error of 2.6 seconds in predicting when each team will score its next point. Moreover, it provided powerful insights such as estimates for the teamsâ€™ performance and the probability of a team winning at any given time.

**Conclusion:** The model was little better than a cumulative average (median absolute error of 3.4 seconds). Therefore, the bayesian model is well suited for a highly accurate analysis, but fails to justify its complexity and computational demand for simpler applications.

## How to use
### ... On VSCode
You can run the project inside a development container by following these steps in VSCode:
- Open VSCode
- Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
- Open the command palette (press `F1` key), select the command "Git: Clone" and clone this repository https://github.com/GiuseppeTT/bayesian-halo.git
- Open the command palette (press `F1` key) and select the command "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
- Open a new terminal (press `` ctrl+shift+` ``) and execute the command `Rscript scripts/set_up.R`
- Open a new terminal (press `` ctrl+shift+` ``) and execute the command `Rscript scripts/make.R`

After that, the report will be available at `output/github-pages/report.html`.

Notes: you may need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Repository structure
The `scripts/make.R` script is the main entrypoint. I recommend to start with this script and later move to `_targets.R`, which defines the pipeline. You may also want to check `.github/workflows/deply.yaml` which is reponsible for running the pipeline on GitHub and deploying to report to GitHub pages.
